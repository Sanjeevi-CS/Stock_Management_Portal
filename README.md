## Literature Survey

### Inventory Control Models

Literature often discusses different inventory control models, including the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model, the Just-In-Time (JIT) system, and the ABC analysis.
Researchers explore the strengths and weaknesses of these models and their suitability for various industries and scenarios.

### Technological Advances

- The integration of technology, such as barcode systems, radio-frequency identification (RFID), and advanced software solutions, has transformed inventory management.
- Studies highlight the benefits of using technology to automate and improve inventory tracking, accuracy, and efficiency.

### Inventory Optimization

- Optimization techniques are explored to determine the optimal inventory levels, considering factors like lead times, carrying costs, and customer demand.
- Literature often covers multi-echelon inventory optimization for complex supply chains.

### Supply Chain Integration

- Inventory management is closely linked to supply chain management.
- Researchers examine the role of integration with suppliers and customers to create efficient and responsive supply chains.

### Inventory Costs

- The costs associated with inventory management are a significant focus, including holding costs, ordering costs, and stockout costs.
- Studies analyze cost trade-offs and strategies to minimize overall inventory costs.

### Inventory Classification

- The ABC analysis categorizes inventory items into classes based on their importance.
- Researchers explore how different inventory items should be managed based on their classification.

### Inventory Accuracy and Control

- Maintaining accurate inventory records and preventing stockouts or overstock situations is essential.
- Literature examines techniques for cycle counting, ABC analysis, and root cause analysis of inventory discrepancies.

### Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)

- VMI is a collaborative inventory management approach where suppliers take responsibility for managing a customer's inventory.
- Research assesses the benefits and challenges of implementing VMI arrangements.

### Sustainability and Green Inventory Management

- Sustainability considerations are gaining importance in inventory management.
- Studies discuss eco-friendly practices, such as reducing excess inventory to minimize waste and energy consumption.

### Cross-Channel Inventory Management

- With the growth of omnichannel retailing, managing inventory across multiple sales channels is a complex challenge.
- Literature addresses strategies for efficient cross-channel inventory management.

### Real-Time Inventory Management

- The need for real-time visibility into inventory levels and transactions is emphasized.
- Research explores technologies like IoT and cloud-based systems for achieving real-time inventory management.
